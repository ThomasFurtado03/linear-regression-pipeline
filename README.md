**Linear Regression Analysis in R**

This repository contains an R script demonstrating multiple linear regression concepts, model diagnostics, and model selection techniques using built-in R datasets. The goal of this project is to show understanding of regression modeling, matrix-based regression foundations, and statistical diagnostics in R.

The script includes:

Matrix-based regression analysis using a design matrix

Eigenvalue decomposition to assess matrix rank and multicollinearity

Linear regression modeling with transformations and interaction terms

Model comparison and improvement using diagnostics

Residual analysis and assumption checking

Variable selection using AIC and stepwise regression

Multicollinearity assessment using VIF

Prediction from fitted regression models

Data visualization using ggplot2 and GGally

Datasets used:
